## Automation

- If you ask an LLM model what **automation** is, it will probably answer this:

> Automation isÂ **the use of technology, systems, or machines to perform tasks and processes with reduced or minimal human involvement.**

- An automation requires a **trigger** (i.e., an event that tells the system or machine to start working) and an **action** (i.e., what the machine is expected to do once it's trigger).
- AI automation does the same thing: it triggers an action when a specific event occurs. However, AI automation uses machine learning, computer vision or large-language models to automate tasks that will normally require a human intervention.

## AI Agents

- An AI agent is a system that can **autonomously** complete tasks and achieve goals on behalf of the user.
- The main features of an AI agent are:
	- **Reasoning.**  They can use the available information to draw conclusions and solve complex problems, without the help of a human.
	- **Acting.** They can achieve goals by performing tasks based on decisions, plans, or external information.
